## As an application evolves and grows in complexity
several factors contribute to the increased complexity. Here are some common ways in which applications tend to grow

Increased Feature Set:

As more features are added to an application, the codebase becomes larger and more complex. Each new feature may introduce new components, logic, and interactions, leading to a more intricate structure.
Scaling User Interface:

As the user interface expands to accommodate more screens, views, and components, managing the state and interactions between various UI elements becomes more challenging.
Data Complexity:

Handling a larger and more diverse set of data can increase complexity. Applications may need to manage complex data structures, relationships, and data fetching from multiple sources.
Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations:

As applications grow, the need for handling asynchronous operations, such as data fetching, increases. Coordinating asynchronous tasks and managing their impact on the application state becomes more complex.
Codebase Size:

A larger codebase with more files and lines of code can make it harder to maintain, navigate, and understand. Large codebases may lead to longer build times and slower development cycles.
Collaboration:

In larger teams, multiple developers may be working on different parts of the application simultaneously. Coordinating efforts, managing code conflicts, and maintaining a consistent code quality become more challenging.
Optimization and Performance:

As applications grow, there's a need for optimization to maintain acceptable performance. This includes optimizing rendering, data fetching, and other critical aspects of the application.
Global State Management:

As the need for shared state between different parts of the application increases, managing global state and ensuring that components have access to the necessary data become more complex.
Third-Party Integrations:

Integrating with external services, APIs, and third-party libraries adds complexity. Handling authentication, managing data from external sources, and ensuring compatibility with external services can be challenging.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

As the application grows, maintaining a high level of code quality becomes crucial. Comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, are necessary to ensure reliability.
Maintainability and Scalability:

The need for maintainability and scalability becomes more apparent as the application grows. Design decisions made in the early stages of development can have long-term implications, and the architecture should be able to scale with the growth of the project.
Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the application's architecture, state management strategy, and development practices. Specialized state management libraries, such as Redux, MobX, or Recoil, can help manage the increasing complexity by providing structured patterns for handling state, organizing code, and facilitating collaboration among developers.
